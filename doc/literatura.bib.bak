    abstract = "In this paper we describe our attempt at producing a state-of-the-art Twitter sentiment classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTMs) networks. Our system leverages a large amount of unlabeled data to pre-train word embeddings. We then use a subset of the unlabeled data to fine tune the embeddings using distant supervision. The final CNNs and LSTMs are trained on the SemEval-2017 Twitter dataset where the embeddings are fined tuned again. To boost performances we ensemble several CNNs and LSTMs together. Our approach achieved first rank on all of the five English subtasks amongst 40 teams.",

Our main focus was topic-based message polarity classification on a two-point scale (subtask B). The system we submitted uses a Support Vector Machine classifier with rich set of features, ranging from standard to more creative, task-specific features, including a series of rating-based features as well as features that account for sentimental reminiscence of past topics and deceased famous people. Our system ranked 14th out of 39 submissions in subtask A, 5th out of 24 submissions in subtask B, and 3rd out of 16 submissions in subtask D.",
